**[CONTRA LA POLICIA]**

All of my Work is against the police.  
If I write a Love poem it's against the police.  
And if I sing to the nakedness of bodies I sing against the police.  
And if I make this Earth a metaphor I make a metaphor against the police.  
If I talk crazy in this poem I'm talking against the police.  
And if I manage to create a poem it's against the police.  
I haven't written a word, a verse, a stanza that's not against the police.  
All of my prose is against the polce.  
All of my Works  
including this poem  
All of my Work  
is against the police.
