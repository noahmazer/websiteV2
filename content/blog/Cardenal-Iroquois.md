**[Kayanerenkowa]**

Sept. Oct.   
in these months are the migrations.  
The tanagers of Ohio  
the kingbirds of Oklahoma and Texas
come to Nicaragua.  
The cormorant comes from Michigan  
to Solentiname  
here they call him the pato-e-chancho.

Yes, like the planes.  
The plane from New York above these solitudes.   
Maybe watching a color movie.  
THE PERFECT FURLOUGH		\*\*\*with Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh***   
above Solentiname.  
And flying  
in a V  
come the Canadian ducks  
do they come from Lake Ontario?

In these months  
the Nicaraguan sky fills with migrating birds  
And the lapwing of the circumpolar region  
in the wild inlet, this "jungle"   
who could have thought it  
has just been in Central Park.   Or at the United Nations?   
Deganawida took his canoe over the lakes…  
From Niagara Falls to Illinois   
the Pax Iroquoia   
"We shall all eat the same beaver from the same plate".  
Not only the absence of war     
It was no     
cold war, the Iroquois peace. They had    
The same word for "Peace" and for "Law"   
Peace was correct action.   
Justice in action.   
The practice of justice between individuals and nations.   
Peace was good government.    

This is strength, o Chiefs:   
never to anger, to have no discords"     
Kaianerekowa ("the Great Peace")  
— Tarachiwagon, the Great Spirit, inspired it.     
The League of Nations was called the "Great Peace"     
and it was sacred.     
The chiefs of the League its priests.     
The hatchet buried so deep so deep     
"that no one shall see it again in the future"     
But the French gave cannons to the Susquehannocks.     
All because of the fur trade...        
  
Deganawida the Huron  
who created the New Mind   
(his name means "Master of Things")   
had visions of a new politics.  
Hiawatha the Onondoga.   
"He Who Combs"   
(because he combed the snakes out of the minds of men)   
was the poet.     
He invented wampum -shell-writing-    
and spun beautiful stories with shells.   
Deganawida took his canoe over the lakes  
looking for the smoke on the shores  
the smoke     
of the councils.     
Always rowing towards the Aurora.     
He Crossed Lake Ontario (Sganydaii-yo, "the Great Beautiful Lake")   
and no smoke was rising.  
The Iroquois were at war.   
Their towns   
quiet  ringed by palisades.   
Kaianerekowa!!! he shouted.

He carried the Mind of the Lord of Life.   
The Good News of Peace   
for the camps. Say to the chiefs   
There will be no more war in the towns   
the villages will have peace       

The peoples should love each other, he said.  
A message in the form of the longhouse   
where there are many fires     
one for each family    
and all together as one single family     
so too: a union of nations     
each nation with their council fire     
and all together will be  
a great Ganonsyoni (the Extended House)   

And instead of killing, you will think   
said Deganawida.  
He came to the nation of the Flint (the Mohawk)  
and camped an afternoon alongside the Mohawk river (New York)  
he sat beneath a tree and smoked his pipe.  
There was founded the League of Nations  
alongside the Mohawk River (New York)     

One afternoon beside the lake     
the poet Hiawatha was saddened.     
He collected shells on the coast  
and threaded them in three rows to show his sadness.  
And lit his fire and said:  
"When someone is saddened  
"as I am now  
"I will console him with these shell strings...   
(Deganawida drew close to Hiawatha's smoke)  
...the sacred rows of shells shall be words  
and these words which are in my hands    
shall be true   
He drew near and took up Hiawatha's shells     
and joined them with others  
and in this way  
the laws of the Great Peace  
were made by the 2 of them   
the New Laws with shells     
each law expressed in a shell row     
the Words of the Great Peace     
for the Oneidas the Onondagas the Cayugas the Senecas     
the lake shells made song     
like the lake sings in the night with its shells  
and on the reservation, in the night     
by the fire, that song   
 is still sung.  
That was a long time ago, the Iroquois say   
the creation of that UN  
"in the dark of long ago and the abyss of time"   
(1450?)   
And the cormorant comes from Michigan...   
Dusk. The jet above La Venada.   
It stayed in the sky  
its trail, chalk scratch  
long, looooooong  
like the island of La Venada.   
The lake air-color   
and Cosme's boat as if floating in the air.   
"Look how it shines" don Rafael says to me. Don Rafaíl.  
Shines.    
Mirror of the Great Spirit!   
There they go, there they go, flying in a V   
black V V V V V V   
the Canadian ducks  
like squadrons of planes   
but they go switching their leader   
and planes don't change formation.   
They'll be coming from Lake Ontario. They'll return  
to Lake Ontario the V's point   
every so often a new duck, but always   
northward like a compass needle   
carrying spring!  
  
Deganawida said  
in the first speech of those United Nations:   
"The Council Fire of the Confederacy of Nations...!   
"But the fires of the nations will stay lit   
"and that of each clan   
"and that of each family and the womens' fire and the mens' fire   
"AND THEY WILL NOT GO OUT...!  
And the League of Nations was established with songs  
delegations circled around the fire  
the Mohawk and the Seneca east of the fire   
the Oneida and the Cayuga west of the fire  
the Onondaga north of the fire   
all of them singing the same song together  

And on closing the First Session of the United Nations:   
“My work is done. I   
"will enter the earth. From there   
"I will hear how men conduct themselves  
"in the Longhouse I gave them  
"If one day the Great peace fails  
"If one day it fails  
"pronounce my name in the depth of the forest   
"In solitude. And I shall return.   
They buried the hatchets the arrows  
We have cleaned the earth   
of these things made by a Bad Mind"   
And after the dream of a greater adventure     
the reunion around a fire     
of all the nations of the earth     
the nations of "all the earth's forests"     

A beaver on the plate. With no knife  
So that no one can be hurt  
there will be no spilling of blood   
Later, for many years, the hope   
that the French would join the League.     
"If you love our souls as you say,     
love also our bodies.     
We shall all be one single nation."   
So that their good intentions would show     
they gave themselves up unarmed to the French.     
With women and children and elders. NOT     
as hostages. But     
"to make all the earth one single nation"     
and the march towards Quebec -weighed down with shells-     
but on the road the Algonquians attacked them.     
the French traded with the Huron...     
Dialogue with the Huron was blocked.  
The treaties with the Huron, annulled forever.  

Economic reasons... that fur trade...   
Because the Iroquois sad: "one single territory"     
"Let us make one single people and one single territory"    
and the French traded with the Hurons.     
The French gave cannons to the Susquehannocks.     
We shall suppress the flows of the river     
And they sent 3 peace canoes to the French. 

Those canoes, stood up before the fort  
 "The earth shall be beautiful-- they cried to them  
 the river shall have no waves   
we shall live everywhere without fear"   
and that night around the fire with the French  
 around the symbol fire:   
"Our faces shall be stuck to yours  
so much that we too will have beards   
and we shall be one single face"   
And the Nation of the Thirteen Fires?  
 Neither did the Nation of the Thirteen Fires  
 enter into the League. 
Ah   
there went the ah-wek-ah-ah.   
It rowed with its wings folded.   
When the Indians of the Great Lakes left   
it opened its wings and flew   
and did not return.

With the wind comes radio, from the island of la Saba.   
The la Saba radio. La saba (La carriba. says don Rafaíl).   
Cormorants in a line with their wings open   
like old shirts on a wire.   
They wet their tails before flying.   
Here and on Lake Michigan.   
Between the buoys of Lake Michigan.   
The lakes had souls, for the Onondaga.   
The laws, spoken in wampum.
And the treaties in wampum.   
They never broke a wampum  
 although treaty after treaty they lost all their lands.   
It gets late. Lake calm. In its soul. And an Onondaga moon.   
Sept. 25. first albatrosses, 3, alongside La Venada   
flying, skimming the water   
Tanagers from Ohio. From Kentucky.  
 Like Merton's letter this Tuesday.   
And Kennedy Airport so close to Solentiname.  
A radio on the island of an Indian Caribbean.  
(La Saba brought me oranges)

We shall all eat, from the same plate,   
one same beaver.   
Soon a bonfire in the forest, shapes spinning   
between fire and shadow, and their shadows spinning  
 da-dun da-dun da-dun, red tattoos   
redder now as the fire climbs. ah uuuum.   
children too and dogs jumping   
young women with shells, with   
wampum. Ah uuuuum. The fire goes out.   
They left. And they were never seen again in history.  
But after the traffic and neon ads in Syracuse   
and passing the highways on the outskirts, motels  
gas stations and more neon, HAM & EGGS in the night  
 behind the big factories, you come to the reservation   
a little valley, where that Iroquois said   
       next to the old Ford that doesn't run   
"we shall rise up again   
and the world shall listen to us."

A man leapt into the middle of the street with his arms open:  
STOP!!! 
and they riddled him.  
A different Somoza will be president.  
You told us to call out to you in our solitude.  
And I’m here in Solentiname!  
Deganawida! Deganawida!  

Rumor as if from a portable radio on its way here  
no portables come here:  
the plane  
from the Nation of the 13 Fires...  
The flight to Panama.  
Our friends aren’t many, and they’re far away.  
The news is bad from everywhere.  
If you are sad as I am now  
I shall console you with my wampum, o my old  
Underwood.  
With shells. With these keys.  
Not teletypes.  
And these words in my hands shall be true.  
It is the hour of the mosquitoes on Solentiname.  
And of the sad bird that sings Jodido.  
The last cormorant has gone.  
Will the lights be on yet  
at the United Nations?  
DEGANAWIDA! DEGANAWIDA!  

And where are the jets going? 
Are they going   
to Vietnam?
