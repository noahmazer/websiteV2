**[COSAS QUE ESCRIBIRÍA SI EL 🌎 SE FUERA A ACABAR]**

my aunt wishes i’d see a therapist  
and i’m scared to see my aunt  
because i had an aunt before who died  
after years of a sickness  
that swallowed her like a wolf  
that chews up its prey in slow motion  
that hurts me  
my aunt is a doctor and insists that she treat me  
beyond psychotropics  
“you’ve suffered so much  
since you were born, even”  
and she’s right:  
i was a sick child  
my existence is a contradiction  
that i’ve been obliged to  
and the medication doesn’t change that  
but an exchange of words
is supposed to?  
isn’t that what poetry is?  
why hasn’t that cured me either?  
i leave some places i go into others  
i feel lost everywhere  
with or without the GPS  
on my phone on  
on my phone i read:  
negative-mass object created  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (they should take a look at our relationship)  
researchers trapped the atoms  
with a laser beam  
use a laser beam to destroy  
my fear of losing you  
until you realize it’s impossible and you get tired  
come disprove the 2nd law of thermodynamics with me  
because i love you and i’m very scared to lose you  
not as scared though as i am  
to say all this in language  
that some people  
might not consider  
“literary”
