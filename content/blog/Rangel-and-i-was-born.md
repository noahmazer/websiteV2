**[y nací agua y nací flor de escupitajos]**

and i was born above the color blue  
and my sense of smell  
i was born in another country  
twenty years gone  
and i was born again here  
twenty years gone  
i never wanted to  
be eternal  
i served more realistic purposes  
like pleasure  
or poetry  
i did some semesters of a degree  
i stared at the sun until my eyes fell apart  
unnecessarily  
i still have things to say now  
like i’m too alive  
and i don’t want to run out of time  
but even more than that i don’t want any extra  

there’s not enough love in the world  
never has been  
besides that, no problems  
the currency will stabilize  
they’ll free some prisoners and jail some others  
the oppressed will oppress and so on  
don’t worry  
the worst thing about things is they always  
get back on track
