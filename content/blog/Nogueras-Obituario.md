**[Obituario]**

*We were a mask, in English pants, Parisian  
vest, a coat from the United States, and a Spanish  
bullfighter's hat.  
MARTÍ*

They buried him in the heart of a pine forest  
and still  
the pinewood coffin was imported from Ohio  
they buried him by an iron mine and still  
the nails of his coffin and the iron of the shovel were imported from Pittsburg;  
they buried him next to the world’s best sheep pasture and still  
the wool of the coffin’s blankets was from California.  
They buried him in a New York suit,  
a pair of Boston shoes,  
a Cincinnati shirt  
and Chicago socks.  
Guatemala provided nothing for the funeral, besides the body.
