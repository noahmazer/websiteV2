**[La Novia de Mi Hermano]**  

Surprising her while she dyes her hair  
is worse than walkng in when she's in the shower.  
She walks between cars  
listening to Selena on her walkman.  
She has a jean jacket  
with cigarettes in its seven pockets.  
My black tees make her laugh  
and she takes me by the arm at parties.  
She walks between cars  
smiling for a camera only she can see.  
She says she can go three days with no sleep  
if the music is good  
and the vodka keeps comng.  
Her boots have heels  
that could murder an elephant.  
She walks between cars  
as if the world had already ended  
bidi bidi  
and she were wandering the ruins with a shotgun  
bom bom.
