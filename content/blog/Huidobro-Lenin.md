## **[Elegia para la muerte de Lenin]**

Greater than the song of life  
greater than death itself  
greater than the pain of memory  
greater than the anguish of time  
is your presence in the soul of the world.  

You, heights-scaling man  
You, heart of tamed fires  
entering the tomb  
you were like a sudden sun in winter  
you were like a summer in death  
with you, death becomes greater than life.

The centuries retreat from your tomb  
jungles and rivers come as pilgrims  
and countries kneel  
cities parade like flags  
and like bandstands  
the remotest villages are like burning crowns  
the sun strews flowers in the streets for your celebration.

Which is the celebration of man:  
the waves leap over each other to arrive first  
to bring you the greetings of their far-off regions  
the sound of seas    
melts into the song of the masses  
your death has created an anniversary  
greater than the anniversary of a mountain.  
You have triumphed, you have triumphed  
a date as great as this one  
has not been worked by men  
you have opened the doors of the new age  
your stature rises  
like a cannon shot that splits human history in two.

A man has passed by Earth  
and left the Earth warm for centuries  
with you, death becomes greater than life.

You are man's nobility  
in you begins a new universal lineage  
and just as your life was the life of life itself  
so will your death be the death of death.   

A man has overturned the mountains   
in the depths of the centuries sound the footsteps of millions of slaves   
which recede over timeâ€™s surface and time resounds with echo upon echo   
there is no more distance between one tribe and the other   
your seed voice that brings the venerable winds   
your voice, Lenin, changes the human race   
and makes one single land out of so many hostile lands   
you are the shape of the centuries to come   
you are the doppelganger of the future   
the roar of hate become the song of love   
obeying the impulses of the Earth   
you cried out to the consciences who sensed not the great rhythm.   

Your call brooks no dissidents   
shadows that fall away from man and let themselves die on the road   
a man has passed by Earth   
and left his burning heart among men.   
You are the image of the centuries to come   
and yours is the voice of the sower   
and men raise their hammers   
and the hammers are left floating in the air   
they raise their sickles and the sickles hang in the light   
they all hear, we all hear   
that beating of your heart beyond death   
that beating of your heart that brings you back to us and makes you present.   

You could say, from death  
"Stars, it was I who set men in motion."   
You are the sound of the dawn when it wakes   
you are the sound of a whole working world, of a whole singing world   
you are the sound of a triumphant star, flying through space.   

What language is that which beats against the rocks of the shore?   
What fuel is that which ripples the infinite wheatfields?  
What words are those that illuminate the night  
and that beating beyond death?  
We have collected your words  
so that all can be human and true   
so that man can be man   
and when your voice has boomed across the world   
the downcast the slaves the helots  
will disappear from the deep hideaways   
and men will appear in every road.   
What language is this which quells hunger and extinguishes thirst?   
What words are these that dress themselves in heat?   

Chains go flying and man flies with them.   
Dead are the last slaves, the last beggars   
who held all of earth's distances in their folded hands   
and we hear that beating of your heart beyond death.  
The man who makes the anvil groan  
the man who makes the stone weep  
the man who casts the closed seeds into the furrows  
the man who raises houses  
the man who builds bridges   
and the one who hears the song of the birds   
and the one who counts the stars sitting in the middle of the night   
the man who manufactures instruments and machines   
the man who changes the way of things   
and the ways of the Earth   
the man who kneads bread and who has the smell of yeast in his eyes   
the man who guides flocks from mountain to mountain    
the man who guides caravans in deserts longer than his own memory.   

All of them hear  
that beating of your heart beyond death.  
The thinking man, the singing man  
the man lonely like the peal of one o'clock bell  
the crowds, slowly dying  
all of them hear your heart beyond death  
your heart ringing out within the tomb  
with you death becomes greater than life  
the centuries retreat from your tomb  
jungles and rivers come as pilgrims  
and countries kneel.  
From now on, our duty is to keep you from becoming a god.
