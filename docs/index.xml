my aunt wishes i‚Äôd see a therapist
and i‚Äôm scared to see my aunt
because i had an aunt before who died
after years of a sickness
that swallowed her like a wolf
that chews up its prey in slow motion
that hurts me
my aunt is a doctor and insists that she treat me
beyond psychotropics
‚Äúyou‚Äôve suffered so much</description>

      <description>[CONTRA LA POLIC√çA]
All of my Work is against the police.
If I write a Love poem it&amp;rsquo;s against the police.
And if I sing to the nakedness of bodies I sing against the police.
And if I make this Earth a metaphor I make a metaphor against the police.
If I talk crazy in this poem I&amp;rsquo;m talking against the police.
And if I manage to create a poem it&amp;rsquo;s against the police.</description>

we should abandon mexico city
like they did teotihuacan
let them not know why
let the myth go on
just that:
the myth of the eagle on the nopal
without the snake
and that one day the eagle decided to fly</description>

      <description>You lose days, strength, and love for the nation,
warm love for the woman loved warmly,
the will to live, sleep, and the right to tenderness;
you walk along there, insight, peace, glowing desire,
hidden desires, full of madness and discoveries,
and you know nothing, because it is said:
you should know nothing
as if words were the dead footsteps of hunger
or the dense wave of vice, beating in your ear,</description>

      <description>[Extra√±o, M√°s Extra√±o]
In the dark I touch America‚Äôs scar
I lay my burning hand
on the volcanic and humid South
from where we came bleeding
alongside other tears. This severe
beauty is the eye of my land,
and its shadow of fire shakes me.
Stay here, bare, don‚Äôt leave.
Deserted, drunk
I shiver in a strange country, stranger still.</description>

      <title>Ernesto Cardenal - Midnight Office</title>

      <description>[Oficio Nocturno]
2 AM. It is the hour of the Midnight Office, and in shadow
the church seems full of demons.
This is the hour of darkness and parties.
The hour of my binges. And my past returns.
&amp;ldquo;And my sin is always before me&amp;rdquo;
And while we recite the psalms, my memories
interfere with prayer like radios and jukeboxes.
Old movie scenes come back, nightmares, hours
alone in hotels, dances, journeys, kisses, bars.</description>

Homeric, a truck
Went by
With a house inside.
No, Salvador, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like that.
It was

With a poem

      <description>[Ulises en aguas de √çtaca]
You arrive on the island: now you know
what fate is, what it means to live.
Your bow will be dust on a shelf.
Dust, the loom and the piece it weaves.
The suitors, who camp in the courtyard,
are shadows of Penelope‚Äôs dreams.
You arrive on the island, while the sea
beats against the rocks of the coast,
as time does against the odyssey. No one</description>

      <description>[La Novia de Mi Hermano]
Surprising her while she dyes her hair
is worse than walkng in when she&amp;rsquo;s in the shower.
She walks between cars
listening to Selena on her walkman.
She has a jean jacket
with cigarettes in its seven pockets.
My black tees make her laugh
and she takes me by the arm at parties.
She walks between cars
smiling for a camera only she can see.</description>

      <description>[Poema XVI]
The laws are made
for the poor to follow. The laws are made by the rich to give a little order to exploitation. The poor are the only followers of the laws of history.
When the poor make the laws the rich will be no more.</description>
