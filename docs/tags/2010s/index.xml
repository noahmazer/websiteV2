      <description>[Poema para una esquina]
There used to be a tree here:
today, my hair grows in its honor
my houseplants, my nails
—everything:
the universe expands in your name.</description>

      <description>[La Novia de Mi Hermano]
Surprising her while she dyes her hair
is worse than walkng in when she&amp;rsquo;s in the shower.
She walks between cars
listening to Selena on her walkman.
She has a jean jacket
with cigarettes in its seven pockets.
My black tees make her laugh
and she takes me by the arm at parties.
She walks between cars
smiling for a camera only she can see.</description>
