      <description>You lose days, strength, and love for the nation,
warm love for the woman loved warmly,
the will to live, sleep, and the right to tenderness;
you walk along there, insight, peace, glowing desire,
hidden desires, full of madness and discoveries,
and you know nothing, because it is said:
you should know nothing
as if words were the dead footsteps of hunger
or the dense wave of vice, beating in your ear,</description>

      <description>[TRÁNSITO]
Homeric, a truck
Went by
With a house inside.
No, Salvador, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like that.
It was

Went by
With a poem
Inside</description>

      <description>[La Novia de Mi Hermano]
Surprising her while she dyes her hair
is worse than walkng in when she&amp;rsquo;s in the shower.
She walks between cars
listening to Selena on her walkman.
She has a jean jacket
with cigarettes in its seven pockets.
My black tees make her laugh
and she takes me by the arm at parties.
She walks between cars
smiling for a camera only she can see.</description>
