      <description>[y nací agua y nací flor de escupitajos]
and i was born above the color blue
and my sense of smell
i was born in another country
twenty years gone
and i was born again here
twenty years gone
i never wanted to
be eternal
i served more realistic purposes
like pleasure
or poetry
i did some semesters of a degree
i stared at the sun until my eyes fell apart</description>

      <description>[Poema para una esquina]
There used to be a tree here:
today, my hair grows in its honor
my houseplants, my nails
—everything:
the universe expands in your name.</description>

      <description>[COSAS QUE ESCRIBIRÍA SI EL 🌎 SE FUERA A ACABAR]
my aunt wishes i’d see a therapist
and i’m scared to see my aunt
because i had an aunt before who died
after years of a sickness
that swallowed her like a wolf
that chews up its prey in slow motion
that hurts me
my aunt is a doctor and insists that she treat me
beyond psychotropics
“you’ve suffered so much</description>

      <description>[Contingencia]
we should abandon mexico city
like they did teotihuacan
let them not know why
let the myth go on
just that:
the myth of the eagle on the nopal
without the snake
and that one day the eagle decided to fly</description>

      <description>You lose days, strength, and love for the nation,
warm love for the woman loved warmly,
the will to live, sleep, and the right to tenderness;
you walk along there, insight, peace, glowing desire,
hidden desires, full of madness and discoveries,
and you know nothing, because it is said:
you should know nothing
as if words were the dead footsteps of hunger
or the dense wave of vice, beating in your ear,</description>

      <description>[TRÁNSITO]
Homeric, a truck
Went by
With a house inside.
No, Salvador, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like that.
It was
Angelic, a poet
Went by
With a poem
Inside</description>

      <description>[La Novia de Mi Hermano]
Surprising her while she dyes her hair
is worse than walkng in when she&amp;rsquo;s in the shower.
She walks between cars
listening to Selena on her walkman.
She has a jean jacket
with cigarettes in its seven pockets.
My black tees make her laugh
and she takes me by the arm at parties.
She walks between cars
smiling for a camera only she can see.</description>
