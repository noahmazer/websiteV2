      <description>[Ayer Vi Pasar Un Camello] Yesterday I saw a camel,
drunk, carrying a book and cursing
pass by my window.
And I would&amp;rsquo;ve been shocked
if, after the camel, a man hadn&amp;rsquo;t passed by
all starched and happy
on his way to work.</description>

      <description>[Poesía y Militancia en América Latina] 1.
What is it I mean to do, working in poetry? In general, to express my life, by which I mean the life to which I’m witness and coauthor. My time, its people, the environment we share, with all its interdependence. I walk towards this goal from the apparently simple starting point of being Salvadoran, which is to say, part of a Latin American people that seeks its happiness fighting against imperialism and the criollo oligarchy that, for well-established historical reasons, has an extraordinarily poor cultural tradition.</description>

      <description>[Kayanerenkowa] Sept. Oct.
in these months are the migrations.
The tanagers of Ohio
the kingbirds of Oklahoma and Texas come to Nicaragua.
The cormorant comes from Michigan
to Solentiname
here they call him the pato-e-chancho.
Yes, like the planes.
The plane from New York above these solitudes.
Maybe watching a color movie.
THE PERFECT FURLOUGH	***with Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh***
above Solentiname.
And flying
in a V
come the Canadian ducks</description>

      <title>Ernesto Cardenal - Midnight Office</title>

      <description>[Oficio Nocturno] 2 AM. It is the hour of the Midnight Office, and in shadow
the church seems full of demons.
This is the hour of darkness and parties.
The hour of my binges. And my past returns.
&amp;ldquo;And my sin is always before me&amp;rdquo;
And while we recite the psalms, my memories
interfere with prayer like radios and jukeboxes.
Old movie scenes come back, nightmares, hours
alone in hotels, dances, journeys, kisses, bars.</description>
