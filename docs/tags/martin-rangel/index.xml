      <description>[y nací agua y nací flor de escupitajos]
and i was born above the color blue
and my sense of smell
i was born in another country
twenty years gone
and i was born again here
twenty years gone
i never wanted to
be eternal
i served more realistic purposes
like pleasure
or poetry
i did some semesters of a degree
i stared at the sun until my eyes fell apart</description>

my aunt wishes i’d see a therapist
and i’m scared to see my aunt
because i had an aunt before who died
after years of a sickness
that swallowed her like a wolf
that chews up its prey in slow motion
that hurts me
my aunt is a doctor and insists that she treat me
beyond psychotropics
“you’ve suffered so much</description>
