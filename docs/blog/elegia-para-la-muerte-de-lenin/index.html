<p>Greater than the song of life<br>
greater than death itself<br>
greater than the pain of memory<br>
greater than the anguish of time<br>
is your presence in the soul of the world.</p>
<p>You, heights-scaling man<br>
You, heart of tamed fires<br>
entering the tomb<br>
you were like a sudden sun in winter<br>
you were like a summer in death<br>
with you, death becomes greater than life.</p>
<p>The centuries retreat from your tomb<br>
jungles and rivers come as pilgrims<br>
and countries kneel<br>
cities parade like flags<br>
and like bandstands<br>
the remotest villages are like burning crowns<br>
the sun strews flowers in the streets for your celebration.</p>
<p>Which is the celebration of man:<br>
the waves leap over each other to arrive first<br>
to bring you the greetings of their far-off regions<br>
the sound of seas <br>
melts into the song of the masses<br>
your death has created an anniversary<br>
greater than the anniversary of a mountain.<br>
You have triumphed, you have triumphed<br>
a date as great as this one<br>
has not been worked by men<br>
you have opened the doors of the new age<br>
your stature rises<br>
like a cannon shot that splits human history in two.</p>
<p>A man has passed by Earth<br>
and left the Earth warm for centuries<br>
with you, death becomes greater than life.</p>
<p>You are man&rsquo;s nobility<br>
in you begins a new universal lineage<br>
and just as your life was the life of life itself<br>
so will your death be the death of death.</p>
<p>A man has overturned the mountains<br>
in the depths of the centuries sound the footsteps of millions of slaves<br>
which recede over time’s surface and time resounds with echo upon echo<br>
there is no more distance between one tribe and the other<br>
your seed voice that brings the venerable winds<br>
your voice, Lenin, changes the human race<br>
and makes one single land out of so many hostile lands<br>
you are the shape of the centuries to come<br>
you are the doppelganger of the future<br>
the roar of hate become the song of love<br>
obeying the impulses of the Earth<br>
you cried out to the consciences who sensed not the great rhythm.</p>
<p>Your call brooks no dissidents<br>
shadows that fall away from man and let themselves die on the road<br>
a man has passed by Earth<br>
and left his burning heart among men.<br>
You are the image of the centuries to come<br>
and yours is the voice of the sower<br>
and men raise their hammers<br>
and the hammers are left floating in the air<br>
they raise their sickles and the sickles hang in the light<br>
they all hear, we all hear<br>
that beating of your heart beyond death<br>
that beating of your heart that brings you back to us and makes you present.</p>
<p>You could say, from death<br>
&ldquo;Stars, it was I who set men in motion.&rdquo;<br>
You are the sound of the dawn when it wakes<br>
you are the sound of a whole working world, of a whole singing world<br>
you are the sound of a triumphant star, flying through space.</p>
<p>What language is that which beats against the rocks of the shore?<br>
What fuel is that which ripples the infinite wheatfields?<br>
What words are those that illuminate the night<br>
and that beating beyond death?<br>
We have collected your words<br>
so that all can be human and true<br>
so that man can be man<br>
and when your voice has boomed across the world<br>
the downcast the slaves the helots<br>
will disappear from the deep hideaways<br>
and men will appear in every road.<br>
What language is this which quells hunger and extinguishes thirst?<br>
What words are these that dress themselves in heat?</p>
<p>Chains go flying and man flies with them.<br>
Dead are the last slaves, the last beggars<br>
who held all of earth&rsquo;s distances in their folded hands<br>
and we hear that beating of your heart beyond death.<br>
The man who makes the anvil groan<br>
the man who makes the stone weep<br>
the man who casts the closed seeds into the furrows<br>
the man who raises houses<br>
the man who builds bridges<br>
and the one who hears the song of the birds<br>
and the one who counts the stars sitting in the middle of the night<br>
the man who manufactures instruments and machines<br>
the man who changes the way of things<br>
and the ways of the Earth<br>
the man who kneads bread and who has the smell of yeast in his eyes<br>
the man who guides flocks from mountain to mountain <br>
the man who guides caravans in deserts longer than his own memory.</p>
<p>All of them hear<br>
that beating of your heart beyond death.<br>
The thinking man, the singing man<br>
the man lonely like the peal of one o&rsquo;clock bell<br>
the crowds, slowly dying<br>
all of them hear your heart beyond death<br>
your heart ringing out within the tomb<br>
with you death becomes greater than life<br>
the centuries retreat from your tomb<br>
jungles and rivers come as pilgrims<br>
and countries kneel.<br>
From now on, our duty is to keep you from becoming a god.</p>
