      <description>[Elegia para la muerte de Lenin] Greater than the song of life
greater than death itself
greater than the pain of memory
greater than the anguish of time
is your presence in the soul of the world.
You, heights-scaling man
You, heart of tamed fires
entering the tomb
you were like a sudden sun in winter
you were like a summer in death
with you, death becomes greater than life.</description>

      <description>[Ayer Vi Pasar Un Camello] Yesterday I saw a camel,
drunk, carrying a book and cursing
pass by my window.
And I would&amp;rsquo;ve been shocked
if, after the camel, a man hadn&amp;rsquo;t passed by
all starched and happy
on his way to work.</description>

      <title>Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui - Outline of an Explanation of Chaplin</title>
      <link>https://noahmazer.com/blog/mariategui-chaplin/</link>

      <description>[Esquema de una explicaci√≥n de Chaplin] The Chaplin issue seems to me, within any explanation of our times, no less considerable than the Lloyd George issue or the MacDonald issue (if we look for equivalents in Great Britain alone). Many have found Henri Poulaille‚Äôs assertion that The Gold Rush (En pos del oro and La quimera del oro are barely approximate translations of this title) is the greatest contemporary novel to be excessive.</description>

      <title>Roque Dalton - Poetry and Militancy in Latin America</title>
      <link>https://noahmazer.com/blog/roque-dalton-poesia-y-militancia/</link>

      <description>[Poes√≠a y Militancia en Am√©rica Latina] 1.
What is it I mean to do, working in poetry? In general, to express my life, by which I mean the life to which I‚Äôm witness and coauthor. My time, its people, the environment we share, with all its interdependence. I walk towards this goal from the apparently simple starting point of being Salvadoran, which is to say, part of a Latin American people that seeks its happiness fighting against imperialism and the criollo oligarchy that, for well-established historical reasons, has an extraordinarily poor cultural tradition.</description>

      <title>Eduardo Galeano - On Roque Dalton </title>

      <description>[Sobre Roque Dalton] Roque Dalton makes the stones laugh. He was the least solemn of all of us, and he pulled Death‚Äôs leg too. So I won‚Äôt go writing, now, a tear-dampened necrology in his memory.
But I can‚Äôt refrain from saying that I was disgusted by the press‚Äôs silence, and I can‚Äôt refrain from noting the double pain that death provokes when you learn about it so late. The teletypes of the big international agencies didn‚Äôt vibrate to report on the murder of the poet.</description>

      <description>[Kayanerenkowa] Sept. Oct.
in these months are the migrations.
The tanagers of Ohio
the kingbirds of Oklahoma and Texas come to Nicaragua.
The cormorant comes from Michigan
to Solentiname
here they call him the pato-e-chancho.
Yes, like the planes.
The plane from New York above these solitudes.
Maybe watching a color movie.
THE PERFECT FURLOUGH	***with Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh***
above Solentiname.
And flying
in a V
come the Canadian ducks</description>

and i was born above the color blue
and my sense of smell
i was born in another country
twenty years gone
and i was born again here
twenty years gone
i never wanted to
be eternal
i served more realistic purposes
like pleasure
or poetry
i did some semesters of a degree
i stared at the sun until my eyes fell apart</description>

my aunt wishes i‚Äôd see a therapist
and i‚Äôm scared to see my aunt
because i had an aunt before who died
after years of a sickness
that swallowed her like a wolf
that chews up its prey in slow motion
that hurts me
my aunt is a doctor and insists that she treat me
beyond psychotropics
‚Äúyou‚Äôve suffered so much</description>

      <description>[CONTRA LA POLIC√çA]
All of my Work is against the police.
If I write a Love poem it&amp;rsquo;s against the police.
And if I sing to the nakedness of bodies I sing against the police.
And if I make this Earth a metaphor I make a metaphor against the police.
If I talk crazy in this poem I&amp;rsquo;m talking against the police.
And if I manage to create a poem it&amp;rsquo;s against the police.</description>

      <description>You lose days, strength, and love for the nation,
warm love for the woman loved warmly,
the will to live, sleep, and the right to tenderness;
you walk along there, insight, peace, glowing desire,
hidden desires, full of madness and discoveries,
and you know nothing, because it is said:
you should know nothing
as if words were the dead footsteps of hunger
or the dense wave of vice, beating in your ear,</description>

      <description>[Oficio Nocturno] 2 AM. It is the hour of the Midnight Office, and in shadow
the church seems full of demons.
This is the hour of darkness and parties.
The hour of my binges. And my past returns.
&amp;ldquo;And my sin is always before me&amp;rdquo;
And while we recite the psalms, my memories
interfere with prayer like radios and jukeboxes.
Old movie scenes come back, nightmares, hours
alone in hotels, dances, journeys, kisses, bars.</description>

You arrive on the island: now you know
what fate is, what it means to live.
Your bow will be dust on a shelf.
Dust, the loom and the piece it weaves.
The suitors, who camp in the courtyard,
are shadows of Penelope‚Äôs dreams.
You arrive on the island, while the sea
beats against the rocks of the coast,
as time does against the odyssey. No one</description>

      <description>[La Novia de Mi Hermano] Surprising her while she dyes her hair
is worse than walkng in when she&amp;rsquo;s in the shower.
She walks between cars

She has a jean jacket
with cigarettes in its seven pockets.
My black tees make her laugh
and she takes me by the arm at parties.
She walks between cars
smiling for a camera only she can see.</description>

      <description>[Poema XVI] The laws are made
for the poor to follow. The laws are made by the rich to give a little order to exploitation. The poor are the only followers of the laws of history.
When the poor make the laws the rich will be no more.</description>
