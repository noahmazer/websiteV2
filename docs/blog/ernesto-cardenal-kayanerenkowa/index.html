<p><strong>[Kayanerenkowa]</strong></p>
<p>Sept. Oct.<br>
in these months are the migrations.<br>
The tanagers of Ohio<br>
the kingbirds of Oklahoma and Texas
come to Nicaragua.<br>
The cormorant comes from Michigan<br>
to Solentiname<br>
here they call him the pato-e-chancho.</p>
<p>Yes, like the planes.<br>
The plane from New York above these solitudes.<br>
Maybe watching a color movie.<br>
THE PERFECT FURLOUGH		***with Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh***<br>
above Solentiname.<br>
And flying<br>
in a V<br>
come the Canadian ducks<br>
do they come from Lake Ontario?</p>
<p>In these months<br>
the Nicaraguan sky fills with migrating birds<br>
And the lapwing of the circumpolar region<br>
in the wild inlet, this &ldquo;jungle&rdquo;<br>
who could have thought it<br>
has just been in Central Park.   Or at the United Nations?<br>
Deganawida took his canoe over the lakes…<br>
From Niagara Falls to Illinois<br>
the Pax Iroquoia<br>
&ldquo;We shall all eat the same beaver from the same plate&rdquo;.<br>
Not only the absence of war  <br>
It was no  <br>
cold war, the Iroquois peace. They had <br>
The same word for &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; and for &ldquo;Law&rdquo;<br>
Peace was correct action.<br>
Justice in action.<br>
The practice of justice between individuals and nations.<br>
Peace was good government.</p>
<p>This is strength, o Chiefs:<br>
never to anger, to have no discords&rdquo;  <br>
Kaianerekowa (&ldquo;the Great Peace&rdquo;)<br>
— Tarachiwagon, the Great Spirit, inspired it.  <br>
The League of Nations was called the &ldquo;Great Peace&rdquo;  <br>
and it was sacred.  <br>
The chiefs of the League its priests.  <br>
The hatchet buried so deep so deep  <br>
&ldquo;that no one shall see it again in the future&rdquo;  <br>
But the French gave cannons to the Susquehannocks.  <br>
All because of the fur trade&hellip;</p>
<p>Deganawida the Huron<br>
who created the New Mind<br>
(his name means &ldquo;Master of Things&rdquo;)<br>
had visions of a new politics.<br>
Hiawatha the Onondoga.<br>
&ldquo;He Who Combs&rdquo;<br>
(because he combed the snakes out of the minds of men)<br>
was the poet.  <br>
He invented wampum -shell-writing- <br>
and spun beautiful stories with shells.<br>
Deganawida took his canoe over the lakes<br>
looking for the smoke on the shores<br>
the smoke  <br>
of the councils.  <br>
Always rowing towards the Aurora.  <br>
He Crossed Lake Ontario (Sganydaii-yo, &ldquo;the Great Beautiful Lake&rdquo;)<br>
and no smoke was rising.<br>
The Iroquois were at war.<br>
Their towns<br>
quiet  ringed by palisades.<br>
Kaianerekowa!!! he shouted.</p>
<p>He carried the Mind of the Lord of Life.<br>
The Good News of Peace<br>
for the camps. Say to the chiefs<br>
There will be no more war in the towns<br>
the villages will have peace</p>
<p>The peoples should love each other, he said.<br>
A message in the form of the longhouse<br>
where there are many fires  <br>
one for each family <br>
and all together as one single family  <br>
so too: a union of nations  <br>
each nation with their council fire  <br>
and all together will be<br>
a great Ganonsyoni (the Extended House)</p>
<p>And instead of killing, you will think<br>
said Deganawida.<br>
He came to the nation of the Flint (the Mohawk)<br>
and camped an afternoon alongside the Mohawk river (New York)<br>
he sat beneath a tree and smoked his pipe.<br>
There was founded the League of Nations<br>
alongside the Mohawk River (New York)</p>
<p>One afternoon beside the lake  <br>
the poet Hiawatha was saddened.  <br>
He collected shells on the coast<br>
and threaded them in three rows to show his sadness.<br>
And lit his fire and said:<br>
&ldquo;When someone is saddened<br>
&ldquo;as I am now<br>
&ldquo;I will console him with these shell strings&hellip;<br>
(Deganawida drew close to Hiawatha&rsquo;s smoke)<br>
&hellip;the sacred rows of shells shall be words<br>
and these words which are in my hands <br>
shall be true<br>
He drew near and took up Hiawatha&rsquo;s shells  <br>
and joined them with others<br>
and in this way<br>
the laws of the Great Peace<br>
were made by the 2 of them<br>
the New Laws with shells  <br>
each law expressed in a shell row  <br>
the Words of the Great Peace  <br>
for the Oneidas the Onondagas the Cayugas the Senecas  <br>
the lake shells made song  <br>
like the lake sings in the night with its shells<br>
and on the reservation, in the night  <br>
by the fire, that song<br>
is still sung.<br>
That was a long time ago, the Iroquois say<br>
the creation of that UN<br>
&ldquo;in the dark of long ago and the abyss of time&rdquo;<br>
(1450?)<br>
And the cormorant comes from Michigan&hellip;<br>
Dusk. The jet above La Venada.<br>
It stayed in the sky<br>
its trail, chalk scratch<br>
long, looooooong<br>
like the island of La Venada.<br>
The lake air-color<br>
and Cosme&rsquo;s boat as if floating in the air.<br>
&ldquo;Look how it shines&rdquo; don Rafael says to me. Don Rafaíl.<br>
Shines. <br>
Mirror of the Great Spirit!<br>
There they go, there they go, flying in a V<br>
black V V V V V V<br>
the Canadian ducks<br>
like squadrons of planes<br>
but they go switching their leader<br>
and planes don&rsquo;t change formation.<br>
They&rsquo;ll be coming from Lake Ontario. They&rsquo;ll return<br>
to Lake Ontario the V&rsquo;s point<br>
every so often a new duck, but always<br>
northward like a compass needle<br>
carrying spring!</p>
<p>Deganawida said<br>
in the first speech of those United Nations:<br>
&ldquo;The Council Fire of the Confederacy of Nations&hellip;!<br>
&ldquo;But the fires of the nations will stay lit<br>
&ldquo;and that of each clan<br>
&ldquo;and that of each family and the womens&rsquo; fire and the mens&rsquo; fire<br>
&ldquo;AND THEY WILL NOT GO OUT&hellip;!<br>
And the League of Nations was established with songs<br>
delegations circled around the fire<br>
the Mohawk and the Seneca east of the fire<br>
the Oneida and the Cayuga west of the fire<br>
the Onondaga north of the fire<br>
all of them singing the same song together</p>
<p>And on closing the First Session of the United Nations:<br>
“My work is done. I<br>
&ldquo;will enter the earth. From there<br>
&ldquo;I will hear how men conduct themselves<br>
&ldquo;in the Longhouse I gave them<br>
&ldquo;If one day the Great peace fails<br>
&ldquo;If one day it fails<br>
&ldquo;pronounce my name in the depth of the forest<br>
&ldquo;In solitude. And I shall return.<br>
They buried the hatchets the arrows<br>
We have cleaned the earth<br>
of these things made by a Bad Mind&rdquo;<br>
And after the dream of a greater adventure  <br>
the reunion around a fire  <br>
of all the nations of the earth  <br>
the nations of &ldquo;all the earth&rsquo;s forests&rdquo;</p>
<p>A beaver on the plate. With no knife<br>
So that no one can be hurt<br>
there will be no spilling of blood<br>
Later, for many years, the hope<br>
that the French would join the League.  <br>
&ldquo;If you love our souls as you say,  <br>
love also our bodies.  <br>
We shall all be one single nation.&rdquo;<br>
So that their good intentions would show  <br>
they gave themselves up unarmed to the French.  <br>
With women and children and elders. NOT  <br>
as hostages. But  <br>
&ldquo;to make all the earth one single nation&rdquo;  <br>
and the march towards Quebec -weighed down with shells-  <br>
but on the road the Algonquians attacked them.  <br>
the French traded with the Huron&hellip;  <br>
Dialogue with the Huron was blocked.<br>
The treaties with the Huron, annulled forever.</p>
<p>Economic reasons&hellip; that fur trade&hellip;<br>
Because the Iroquois sad: &ldquo;one single territory&rdquo;  <br>
&ldquo;Let us make one single people and one single territory&rdquo; <br>
and the French traded with the Hurons.  <br>
The French gave cannons to the Susquehannocks.  <br>
We shall suppress the flows of the river  <br>
And they sent 3 peace canoes to the French.</p>
<p>Those canoes, stood up before the fort<br>
&ldquo;The earth shall be beautiful&ndash; they cried to them<br>
the river shall have no waves<br>
we shall live everywhere without fear&rdquo;<br>
and that night around the fire with the French<br>
around the symbol fire:<br>
&ldquo;Our faces shall be stuck to yours<br>
so much that we too will have beards<br>
and we shall be one single face&rdquo;<br>
And the Nation of the Thirteen Fires?<br>
Neither did the Nation of the Thirteen Fires<br>
enter into the League. 
Ah<br>
there went the ah-wek-ah-ah.<br>
It rowed with its wings folded.<br>
When the Indians of the Great Lakes left<br>
it opened its wings and flew<br>
and did not return.</p>
<p>With the wind comes radio, from the island of la Saba.<br>
The la Saba radio. La saba (La carriba. says don Rafaíl).<br>
Cormorants in a line with their wings open<br>
like old shirts on a wire.<br>
They wet their tails before flying.<br>
Here and on Lake Michigan.<br>
Between the buoys of Lake Michigan.<br>
The lakes had souls, for the Onondaga.<br>
The laws, spoken in wampum.
And the treaties in wampum.<br>
They never broke a wampum<br>
although treaty after treaty they lost all their lands.<br>
It gets late. Lake calm. In its soul. And an Onondaga moon.<br>
Sept. 25. first albatrosses, 3, alongside La Venada<br>
flying, skimming the water<br>
Tanagers from Ohio. From Kentucky.<br>
Like Merton&rsquo;s letter this Tuesday.<br>
And Kennedy Airport so close to Solentiname.<br>
A radio on the island of an Indian Caribbean.<br>
(La Saba brought me oranges)</p>
<p>We shall all eat, from the same plate,<br>
one same beaver.<br>
Soon a bonfire in the forest, shapes spinning<br>
between fire and shadow, and their shadows spinning<br>
da-dun da-dun da-dun, red tattoos<br>
redder now as the fire climbs. ah uuuum.<br>
children too and dogs jumping<br>
young women with shells, with<br>
wampum. Ah uuuuum. The fire goes out.<br>
They left. And they were never seen again in history.<br>
But after the traffic and neon ads in Syracuse<br>
and passing the highways on the outskirts, motels<br>
gas stations and more neon, HAM &amp; EGGS in the night<br>
behind the big factories, you come to the reservation<br>
a little valley, where that Iroquois said<br>
next to the old Ford that doesn&rsquo;t run<br>
&ldquo;we shall rise up again<br>
and the world shall listen to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man leapt into the middle of the street with his arms open:<br>
STOP!!! 
and they riddled him.<br>
A different Somoza will be president.<br>
You told us to call out to you in our solitude.<br>
And I’m here in Solentiname!<br>
Deganawida! Deganawida!</p>
<p>Rumor as if from a portable radio on its way here<br>
no portables come here:<br>
the plane<br>
from the Nation of the 13 Fires&hellip;<br>
The flight to Panama.<br>
Our friends aren’t many, and they’re far away.<br>
The news is bad from everywhere.<br>
If you are sad as I am now<br>
I shall console you with my wampum, o my old<br>
Underwood.<br>
With shells. With these keys.<br>
Not teletypes.<br>
And these words in my hands shall be true.<br>
It is the hour of the mosquitoes on Solentiname.<br>
And of the sad bird that sings Jodido.<br>
The last cormorant has gone.<br>
Will the lights be on yet<br>
at the United Nations?<br>
DEGANAWIDA! DEGANAWIDA!</p>
<p>And where are the jets going? 
Are they going<br>
to Vietnam?</p>
